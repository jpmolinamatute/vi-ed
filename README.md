# vi-ed (Visual Editor)

vi-ed is a Visual Editor that **WILL** (some day in the future) allow people to build their own website reactive and responsive.
I'm using [meteor 1.1](https://www.meteor.com/). This is just a personal project where I can try new stuff that I find on internet :-)

You can see my work (in progress) in [here](https://vi-ed.herokuapp.com/)
